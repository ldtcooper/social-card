This is a simple clone of the Twitter social card using React. You can check it out [here](logan-cooper.com/social-card/).

The React boilerplate was generated with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). It pulls random quotes from the [Forismatic API](https://forismatic.com/en/api/) to give the 'tweets' authors and text content, and pulls the avatar and tweet images from [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/). The API calls were facilitated with [fetch-jsonp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fetch-jsonp).
